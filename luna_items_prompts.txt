Balanced Diet: Luna seated at a sunlit wooden table, savoring a balanced plate piled with colorful vegetables, whole grains, and ripe fruits; each bite glows faintly with nourishing light, suggesting restored vigor and quiet contentment.


=== Missing Cards Art ===
Oracle Prayer Charm (oracleprayercharm.png): Luna Midori clasping a delicate silver prayer charm against her chest, etched with tiny constellations and a central radiant gem that blooms with warm golden light; soft rays spill across a parchment altar as she whispers a blessing, hinting at protective healing magic. Render as a cozy, painterly illustration suitable for a small card icon.


=== Missing Relics Art ===
Field Rations (field_rations.png): Luna Midori perched at a twilight camp table, unpacking a weathered satchel of neatly wrapped ration packs while lifting a steaming tin cup and a faintly glowing restorative vial; cool moonlight mixes with ember sparks to convey post-battle recovery. Stylize as a crisp overhead concept-art painting.

Featherweight Anklet (featherweight_anklet.png): Luna Midori fastening a sleek metal anklet studded with azure runes as translucent feather charms trail mid-sway above a blurred cobblestone path; subtle motion blur and airy lighting emphasize the surge of agility and speed she feels. Paint in a vibrant fantasy UI art style with high contrast.

Copper Siphon (coppersiphon.png): Luna Midori holding an ornate copper siphon tube with intricate spiral engravings that glow crimson red, as ethereal wisps of vampiric energy flow from defeated foes into the tube and then shimmer into healing light around her wounds; dark battlefield background with scattered embers and faint blood-red mist. Render in a dramatic fantasy art style with high contrast between the copper glow and dark surroundings.
