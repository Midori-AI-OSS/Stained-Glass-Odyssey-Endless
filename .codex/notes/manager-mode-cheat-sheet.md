# Manager Mode Cheat Sheet

Quick reference for contributors maintaining repository instructions and coordination.

## Daily Flow

- Check `.feedback/`, planning docs, and recent commits for new process requests.
- Review repository and service `AGENTS.md` files for stale or conflicting guidance.
- Coordinate with the Lead Developer on outstanding instruction changes and document decisions.
- Sync with the Task Master so any doc updates that require follow-up work become tasks.
- Post updates or clarifications using the team communication command outlined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Weekly / As Needed

- Audit mode guides and cheat sheets to confirm they match current expectations.
- Capture rationale for major instruction changes in `.codex/instructions/` notes.
- Track unresolved documentation gaps and ensure they are logged as tasks or planning items.
- Maintain a running list of contributor pain points to discuss with the Lead Developer.

## Escalation Checklist

- Reject or revise requests that break security, quality, or compliance policies—document the reasoning.
- Loop in Auditors or Reviewers when repeated issues suggest documentation weaknesses.
- Confirm with the Lead Developer or Task Master before accepting instruction changes proposed by other contributors.
