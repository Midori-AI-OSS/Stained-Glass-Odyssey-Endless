# MEDIUM-003: Arc Lightning ATK Percentage Mismatch

**Issue ID**: MEDIUM-003  
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Entity Type**: Card  
**Entity**: Arc Lightning  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Origin**: Code Audit - Card Behavior Verification  

## Problem Description

Arc Lightning card has a discrepancy between its claimed ATK bonus (255%) and its actual implemented bonus (255% as decimal 2.55).

## Claimed Behavior

**Source**: `backend/plugins/cards/arc_lightning.py` line 19  
**Description**: "+255% ATK; every attack chains 50% of dealt damage to a random foe."

## Actual Behavior

**Observed**: The card implements `effects: {"atk": 2.55}` which translates to a 255% increase
- The effects system uses multipliers where 2.55 = 255% increase (155% of base + 100% = 255% total)
- The description correctly states "+255% ATK"
- The implementation is actually correct

## Analysis

**Status**: ✅ NO ISSUE - This is actually correct implementation
- `atk: 2.55` = 2.55x multiplier = 255% increase ✓
- Chain damage: 50% of dealt damage ✓ (implemented as `int(amount * 0.5)`)
- Targets random foe ✓
- Excludes original target ✓

## Technical Verification

**File**: `backend/plugins/cards/arc_lightning.py`
- Line 17: `effects: {"atk": 2.55}` = 255% ATK boost ✓
- Line 19: Description matches implementation ✓  
- Line 45: Chain damage = 50% ✓ (`amount * 0.5`)
- Line 44: Random target selection ✓
- Line 41: Excludes dead foes and original target ✓

## Conclusion

This card implementation is **CORRECT**. No issue exists.
- Mathematical calculation: 2.55 multiplier = 255% increase ✓
- Chain lightning behavior matches description ✓
- Event handling and damage application properly implemented ✓

**Resolution**: Closing as false positive - implementation matches claimed behavior.
