# LOW-001: Orphaned Passive Implementations

**Issue ID**: LOW-001  
**Severity**: LOW  
**Entity Type**: Passive System  
**Entities**: advanced_combat_synergy, room_heal  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Origin**: Character Ability Audit (17001dd5)  

## Problem Description

Two passive abilities are implemented in the codebase but not assigned to any playable character, resulting in unreachable code that serves no gameplay function.

## Claimed Behavior

**Source**: Passive system design expectations  
**Expected**: All implemented passives should be used by at least one character, or marked as deprecated/removed

## Actual Behavior

**Observed**: Passives exist but are never applied to characters
- `advanced_combat_synergy` - Fully implemented but no character uses it
- `room_heal` - Fully implemented but no character uses it
- Code exists in passive registry but is effectively dead code

## Technical Details

**Orphaned Passive Files:**
- `backend/plugins/passives/advanced_combat_synergy.py`
- `backend/plugins/passives/room_heal.py`

**Investigation Results:**
- Both passives have complete implementations
- No character in `backend/plugins/players/` references these passive IDs
- Passives are discoverable by plugin system but never instantiated

## Impact Assessment

- **Code Maintenance**: Dead code increases maintenance burden
- **Performance**: Minimal - passives load but aren't used
- **Confusion**: Developers may wonder about intended usage
- **Documentation**: May be documented but not functional

## Investigation Required

1. **Check git history** to see if these passives were removed from characters
2. **Review documentation** to see if they're mentioned as available
3. **Examine passive effects** to determine if they should be assigned
4. **Verify no test code** depends on these passives

## Passive Behaviors to Review

### advanced_combat_synergy
- **File**: `backend/plugins/passives/advanced_combat_synergy.py`
- **Behavior**: [Need to examine implementation]
- **Potential Characters**: [Need to determine appropriate assignment]

### room_heal  
- **File**: `backend/plugins/passives/room_heal.py`
- **Behavior**: [Need to examine implementation]
- **Potential Characters**: [Need to determine appropriate assignment]

## Suggested Fix Options

### Option 1: Assign to Characters
Identify appropriate characters and assign these passives

### Option 2: Remove Dead Code
Delete unused passive implementations

### Option 3: Mark as Templates
Document as reference implementations for future characters

### Option 4: Create Test Characters
Add these to test characters for validation purposes

## Files Requiring Action

- `backend/plugins/passives/advanced_combat_synergy.py` - Review or remove
- `backend/plugins/passives/room_heal.py` - Review or remove
- Character files - Consider assigning orphaned passives
- Documentation - Update passive availability lists
