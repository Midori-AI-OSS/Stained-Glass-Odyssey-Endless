# Crafting Menu (Removed)

The previous crafting menu allowed players to manually convert upgrade items or
toggle an auto-craft setting. The system has been simplified: upgrade materials
now auto-craft into higher tiers immediately, and surplus 4★ items remain in the
inventory. Manual crafting, ticket conversion, and the `CraftingMenu.svelte`
component have been removed.
