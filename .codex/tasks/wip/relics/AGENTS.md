# Relic Tasks - Work In Progress
Ready for Review

Tasks in this folder focus on relic implementation.

Documentation reminder: relic plugins already document effects and triggers. Avoid adding task requirements to update `.codex/implementation/relic-system.md` or other roll-up docs; keep the plugin files up to date instead.
