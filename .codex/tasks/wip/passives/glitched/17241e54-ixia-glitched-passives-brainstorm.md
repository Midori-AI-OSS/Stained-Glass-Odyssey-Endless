# Task: Brainstorm Glitched Tier Tagged Passives for Ixia

## Background
Ixia's core moveset and lore live in `backend/plugins/characters/ixia.py`. We still need glitched-tag passives that warp the character's behavior in unpredictable or corrupted ways so future Tier-Glitched work has a clear head start. This is an ideation task only—capture concepts Coders can later formalize inside `backend/plugins/passives/glitched/ixia.py`.

## Brainstorm Focus
- Introduce volatility, trade-offs, or corrupted resource loops that still stay fair to fight.
- Show how the glitch motif distorts existing abilities (timing errors, duplicate actions, stat flicker, etc.).
- Account for readability so players can learn to counter or exploit the glitch state.

## Deliverables
- Capture all brainstorming directly inside this Markdown file; do not link out to other docs.
- Provide **three to five** candidate passive concepts tailored to this tag.
- For each option list: name, one-sentence fantasy hook, mechanical outline (trigger + effect), synergy callout to existing weapons/skills/resources, and any tuning knobs or risks. Capture the glitch fantasy plus the risk/reward profile for each concept.
- Include at least one note on UI/log copy or telegraph ideas so the behaviour can be surfaced in game.
- Call out open questions that need design buy-in (stack caps, cooldown windows, conflicting systems, etc.).

## Reference Material
- Character plugin: `backend/plugins/characters/ixia.py`
- Tier guidance: `.codex/tasks/passives/glitched/AGENTS.md`
- Existing passives directory for tone/language examples.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Document lists at least three well-explained concepts that match the character fantasy and the glitched tier brief.
- Ideas stay within the tag's power band and leave room for other tiers to escalate separately.
- Notes clearly separate must-have behaviour from optional stretch goals.
- No code changes are performed as part of this task—output is a written brainstorming brief ready for review.
