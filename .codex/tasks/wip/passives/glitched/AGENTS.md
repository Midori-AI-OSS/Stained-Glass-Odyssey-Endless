# Glitched Tier Passive Tasks - Work In Progress

Glitched-tier passive modifiers represent unusual or unexpected versions of normal passives with unique mechanics.

Tasks in this folder focus on implementing, balancing, and maintaining glitched-tier passive plugins. These are encounter-based tags applied by the foe factory and layer on top of base character implementations.

Documentation reminder: glitched passive plugins capture the official behaviour and descriptive copy in their about/describe() output. Do not request updates to `.codex/implementation/relic-system.md` or parallel summary docs when writing or reviewing glitched passive tasks; keeping the plugin modules accurate is sufficient.
