# Add Looks String to Casno Character

## Description
Add a `looks` field to the Casno character class (`backend/plugins/characters/casno.py`) following the format used in Luna, Ryne, Lady Light, and Lady Darkness.

- `backend/plugins/characters/ryne.py` (lines 24-54)
- `backend/plugins/characters/lady_light.py` (lines 16-24)
- `backend/plugins/characters/lady_darkness.py` (lines 16-25)

## Appearance Description
**Character Details:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Race:** Human
- **Apparent Age:** Mid-20s (approximately 25)
- **Hair:** Red
- **Build:** Fit, powerful-looking
- **Overall Impression:** Strong, commanding presence
