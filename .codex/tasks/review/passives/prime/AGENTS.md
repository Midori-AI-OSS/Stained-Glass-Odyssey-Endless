# Prime Tier Passive Tasks - Ready for Review

Prime-tier passive modifiers represent elite versions of normal passives with enhanced effects.

Tasks in this folder focus on implementing, balancing, and maintaining prime-tier passive plugins. These are encounter-based tags applied by the foe factory and layer on top of base character implementations.

Documentation reminder: prime passive plugins capture the official behaviour and descriptive copy in their about/describe() output. Do not request updates to `.codex/implementation/relic-system.md` or parallel summary docs when writing or reviewing prime passive tasks; keeping the plugin modules accurate is sufficient.
