# Boss Tier Passive Tasks - Task Master Review

Boss-tier passive modifiers represent enhanced versions of normal passives applied during boss encounters.

Tasks in this folder focus on implementing, balancing, and maintaining boss-tier passive plugins. These are encounter-based tags applied by the foe factory and layer on top of base character implementations.

Documentation reminder: boss passive plugins capture the official behaviour and descriptive copy in their about/describe() output. Do not request updates to `.codex/implementation/relic-system.md` or parallel summary docs when writing or reviewing boss passive tasks; keeping the plugin modules accurate is sufficient.
