# Card Tasks - Task Master Review

Card implementation tasks in this folder have been audited and are awaiting final Task Master sign-off.

When placeholder card art is required, update `luna_items_prompts.txt` with a text-to-photo prompt of Luna using the item that should appear in the image. After saving the prompt, unblock any card tasks that were waiting on that placeholder art. Once the prompt is recorded, placeholder art is fully complete even if a `.png` asset is not yet present—Luna Midori (Lead Developer) will hand-create the final files from the prompt list. Auditors should treat these tasks as satisfied and must not raise findings for the missing `.png` while it is in the Lead Developer queue.

Documentation reminder: card plugins already document star rank, effects, and triggers. Avoid adding task requirements to update `.codex/implementation/relic-system.md` or other roll-up docs; keep the plugin files up to date instead.
