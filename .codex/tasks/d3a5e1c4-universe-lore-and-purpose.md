Storyteller, document the multiverse setting and party motivations based on developer guidance.

## Requirements
- Add `setting-focus.md` under `.codex/lore/notes` describing the universe of worlds and the origins of personas.
- Update `character-connections.md` to note that Lady Darkness is from another world and knows Luna only through the relic **Essence of 6858**.
- Create `guiding-purpose.md` under `.codex/lore/planning` outlining current theories for the party's ascent and mark it for clarification.

## Notes
- Reference `backend/plugins/relics/fallback_essence.py` to confirm the relic's name.
