# Align reward automation & docs with four-phase flow

## Summary
Umbrella pointer covering automation, regression coverage, and documentation updates for the four-phase reward overlay. Work is split across dedicated tasks to keep ownership clear.

## Subtasks
- `.codex/tasks/68168a61-reward-automation-advance-hooks.md` — update idle automation scripts to use the new hooks.
- `.codex/tasks/b8904271-reward-regression-coverage.md` — extend regression coverage with countdown and confirm scenarios.
- `.codex/tasks/2d6e3f12-reward-overlay-docs-update.md` — refresh documentation and fixtures for the new flow.

## Notes
- Coordinate timing with the UI subtasks so automation/tests target the finalised hooks and styling.
- Once all child tasks close, revisit this parent to confirm no further follow-up is required.
