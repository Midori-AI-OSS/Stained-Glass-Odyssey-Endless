# Task Priority Guidance

Tasks in this folder are lower priority than tasks in the parent `.codex/tasks` directory.

When placeholder card art is required, update `luna_items_prompts.txt` with a text-to-photo prompt of Luna using the item that should appear in the image. After saving the prompt, unblock any card tasks that were waiting on that placeholder art.
