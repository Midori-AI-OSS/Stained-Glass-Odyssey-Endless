# Task Priority Guidance

Tasks in this folder are lower priority than tasks in the parent `.codex/tasks` directory.

Documentation reminder: passive plugins capture the official behaviour and descriptive copy. Do not request updates to `.codex/implementation/relic-system.md` or parallel summary docs when writing or reviewing passive tasks; keeping the plugin accurate is enough.
