# Refresh reward flow docs for staging and previews

## Summary
Document the new staged reward pipeline so plugin authors, designers, and QA understand how to supply preview data and when effects finalize. Capture state diagrams, API hooks, and best practices in the relevant `.codex/instructions/` and implementation notes.

## Deliverables
- Update backend reward service documentation to describe staging, preview metadata, and confirmation steps.
- Add guidance for card/relic plugin authors on declaring preview output and activation hooks.
- Provide QA checklists covering preview display, confirmation, and rollback behaviors.

## Why this matters for players
Clear documentation speeds up adoption of the staging system, meaning more rewards arrive with accurate previews and fewer bugs. Faster iteration keeps the game feeling polished and responsive to player feedback.
