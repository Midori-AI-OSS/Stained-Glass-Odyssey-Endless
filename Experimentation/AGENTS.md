# Experimentation — Developer Experiments

These directories contain experimental projects and prototypes created by the developer for personal exploration and rapid prototyping.

- These are not part of the main product and may be unstable or incomplete.
- Do not modify, refactor, or depend on these projects unless you have an explicit task request or approval from the maintainers.
- If you need work done here, open an issue or request permission from the repository owners before proceeding.

Treat these folders as developer experiments — work only when explicitly requested.
