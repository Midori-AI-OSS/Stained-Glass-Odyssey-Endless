# StarStorm Component

Renders a small constellation of orbiting element-colored orbs. Each orb has a fixed position, radius, and drift timing, and is rendered exactly once with a tinted core masked by a radial alpha falloff so the disc softly fades to transparent instead of cutting off at the rim. A blurred glow pseudo-element sits beneath the core so overlapping orbs bloom into one another under `mix-blend-mode: screen`. Slow transform/opacity animations are handled purely in CSS, so retinting the `StarStorm` background simply updates gradient stops instead of respawning DOM nodes. A reduced-motion branch swaps the animation for a static blended gradient so the background remains gently tinted without movement, and the glow/mask layers are skipped entirely.
